    *   sendReminders needs to atomically:
    *
    *   - find all the reminders that haven't been triggered and that now need
    *     to be triggered
    *   - trigger those reminders
    *   - update the reminders (marking them as triggered)
    *
    *   Context:
    *
    *   - there are multiple bot instances reading/writing from the database
    *   - mongodb doesn't provide many facilities to perform atomic transactions
    *   - we're actually working with an Azure DocumentDb exposing part of the
    *     mongodb API, so we don't know which features of mongodb are
    *     implemented
    *
    *   This basically means that we can't have atomicity guarantees from the
    *   database. So, to mitigate the risk of race-conditions which could lead
    *   to the user being "reminded" multiple times, instead of simply:
    *
    *   - reading the list of reminders to trigger
    *   - trigger them
    *   - mark the reminders as triggered
    *
    *   we instead:
    *
    *   - update the reminders, assigning them a random id identifying the "send
    *     reminders" operation we're performing
    *   - wait for some seconds
    *   - find the reminders with our operation id and trigger them
    *
    *   By doing this if some processes are cuncurrently updating the reminders,
    *   after some seconds all updates will have terminated (hopefully, this is
    *   our assumption, and the point where the procedure can fail). Each
    *   process can then trigger the reminders left matching its operation id.
    *   Due to concurrent updates to the database, those reminders might not be
    *   all the ones that the process previously updated, but we obtain that all
    *   reminders will be triggered and no reminder will be triggered twice.
